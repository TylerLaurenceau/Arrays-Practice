![Placing arrays](http://derickbailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/array-filtering.jpeg)

In this practice i've completed some basic interview questions using arrays.


Here is what i've learned from completing this assessment:

#Javascript:
* How to index into an array.
* How to turn the index into that specific item in an array and return it.
* Better understanding of for loops.
* Better understanding of functions.
* How to use the `.push` method.
* How to index into strings and pull out a specific letter.
* Better understanding of when to use returns.
* How to efficiently use a counter in a for loop.
